Simon Game
Welcome to the Simon Game! This project is a recreation of the classic memory game where players must repeat sequences of colors and sounds. It’s built using JavaScript and jQuery, with some fun animations and effects to enhance the user experience.

Features:
• Interactive Gameplay: The game presents sequences of colors and sounds that players must repeat in the correct order.
• Dynamic Animations: Each button click triggers:
              ⦾ Unique sound effects.
              ⦾ A fade-in-and-out effect on the button.
              ⦾ Small polygons that burst, enlarge, and move away from the click point.
• Responsive Start/Restart: Start or restart the game by pressing any key on your keyboard.
• Visual Feedback: The background color changes with each correct sequence, adding to the immersive experience.

How to Play:
• Start the Game: Press any key to start the game.
• Watch the Sequence: The game will flash a sequence of colors and play corresponding sounds.
• Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence you just saw.
• Level Up: With each correct sequence, the game adds another step to the sequence. See how long you can keep up!
• Restart: If you make a mistake, press any key to restart the game.
